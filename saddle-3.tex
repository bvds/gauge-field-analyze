\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Since Wilson introduced his lattice action in 1974~\cite{wilson_confinement_1974},
lattice gauge theory has become the tool of choice for
non-perturbative studies of QCD.  Although numerical
calculations using Wilson's lattice have generated numerous
physical results, the nature of the QCD vacuum itself
has remained somewhat of a mystery.

% In 1982 't Hooft suggested that center vortices could
% explain confinement and subsequent numerical experiments
% using maximal abelian gauge have lent some evidence for this
% picture.  However, there has been little progress in taking
% this picture and creating a full description of the
% QCD vacuum state.  [Hugo Reinhardt's ugly paper is a
% heroic attempt in this direction.]

In 1979, Witten pointed out that QCD has some rather remarkable
properties in the $N \to \infty$ limit.  In particular,
expectation values of observables become dominated by a single
classical configuration of the gauge field, the
``master field''~\cite{witten_1/n_1980}.
Although this idea was compelling, there seemed to be no
way to figure out exactly what this Master Field could be.

However, in the intervening 40 years, we have learned a number
of things that make the quest for the master field perhaps
attainable.  We note the following:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Quarks are not important.  In the language of Lattice QCD,
 one says that the quenched approximation (no dynamical
 quarks) is a good approximation to the full theory.  Numerous
 lattice calculations have given us a good understanding
 of the size and nature of this approximation.

\item The $N\to\infty$ limit of QCD is a good approximation to the
 physical case $N=3$.  This has been demonstrated in numerous
 perturbative and non-perturbative calculations~\cite{lucini_sun_2013}.
 In particular, Teper and collaborators have shown this to be the case for
 the glueball spectrum in both 2+1~\cite{teper_$mathrmsun$_1998,lucini_$mathrmsun$_2002,athenodorou_sun_2017}
 and 3+1 dimensions~\cite{teper_large-n_2005}.  Indeed, properties
 of the $N\to\infty$ master field should be seen, in an approximate sense,
 in $\SU(2)$ and $\SU(3)$ calculations.

\item The behavior of $\SU(N)$ gauge theory in 3 space-time dimensions
  is remarkably similar to the 4 dimensional theory~\cite{teper_$mathrmsun$_1998,lucini_$mathrmsun$_2002,teper_large-n_2005}.
  Although the scale is generated quite differently in each case ---
  in 4 dimensions, it is generated dynamically through quantum
  fluctuations while in 3 dimensions the coupling is dimensionful ---
  once a scale is generated, the theories behave in a very similar manner.

\end{enumerate}

These facts suggest a research program for studying the QCD vacuum state:
one should look at approximate saddle-points of the gauge field action
in 3 spacetime dimensions for various values of $N$, looking for a
description that emerges in the $N\to \infty$ limit.
Hopefully, this description
can then be generalized to the 4 dimensional theory.

If we take the Master Field picture seriously, then a typical gauge
field configuration in a finite $N$ Monte Carlo simulation should
contain some approximation of this master field and should be able to
produce the full spectrum of long-range observables. This
approximation should become increasingly precise as $N\to\infty$.

In the present work, we will pursue the first steps of this program.
We will start with conventional 2+1 dimension lattice gauge
theory field configurations for various values of $N$ and
calculate the nearest associated saddle-point configurations.
Using these configurations we can determing  measure various
physical observables and see how well they approximate the
full theory.

We will pay special attention to Landau gauge transformed
field configurations.  Landau gauge gives us the best hope
of connecting the Wilson link variables to the continuum
Yang Mills fields.

\section{Definitions}

The purpose of the section is to set some notation.

\subsection{The Wilson action}

We introduce a periodic $D$-dimensional spacetime lattice with lattice
spacing $a$ and sites labeled by $x$, with a total of $V_L$ sites.
The lattice has $L_\mu$ sites in direction $\mu$;
in the case of a cubic lattice, we will drop the $\mu$ subscript
and $V_L = L^D$.
Define $U_\mu(x) \in \SU(N)$ to be the link going from site $x$ to
site $x+a \hat{\mu}$.
The lattice has $n_L=V_L D \left(N^2-1\right)$ degrees of freedom.
Let lattice configuration
$\config=\left\{U_1(x_1),\ldots\right\}$
be a particular set of link fields that cover the lattice.

If $\plaquette_{\mu,\nu}(x)$ is a plaquette lying in the $\mu\nu$-plane,
\be
\plaquette_{\mu,\nu}(x) = \Tr U_\mu(x) U_\nu(x+a \hat{\mu})
U_\mu^\da(x+a\hat{\nu}) U_\nu^\da(x) \; ,
\eq
then the Wilson action is
%
\be
S = \beta \sum_{x,\, \mu<\nu} \left(1-\frac{1}{N} \Re\, \plaquette_{\mu,\nu}(x)\right) \label{action}
\eq
where
\be
\beta=\frac{2 N}{a g^2}
\eq
so that $S$ becomes the usual Yang-Mills action in the $a\to 0$ limit.
In $D=3$ dimensions, the coupling $g$ has dimensions of
$\left(\mbox{mass}\right)^{1/2}$, consistent with $\beta$ being dimensionless.
%It is sometimes convenient to use the average plaquette,
%\be
%      \plaquette_\mathrm{avg} = \frac{2}{n_L (D-1) N}
%             \sum_{x,\,\mu<\nu} \Re\,\plaquette_{\mu,\nu}(x) 
%\eq
%with normalization such that $\plaquette_\mathrm{avg}=1$
%for the bare vacuum configuration $U_\mu(x) = \mathbb{I}$.

The Wilson action is invariant under $\SU(N)$ gauge transforms:
%
\be
    U_\mu(x) \to U_\mu^\prime(x) = U_G(x) U_\mu(x) U_G^\da(x+a \hat{\mu})
         \; , \quad U_G(x) \in \SU(N) \; . \label{gauget}
\eq
%
The lattice has a total of $n_G = V_L\left(N^2-1\right)$ gauge symmetries.

\subsection{Norms}

It is useful to define a number of norms.  We define the norm
of a link field using the Frobenius norm of the logarithm,
%
\be
   \fnorm{U_\mu(x)} =
   \sqrt{\Tr M M^\dagger} \quad \mbox{where}
   \quad M = \log\left(U_\mu(x)\right)
   \label{sunorm}
\eq
and the matrix logarithm is defined in Appendix~\ref{roots}.
Note that the norm reaches its maximum value for non-identity
elements of the center $\zentrum$ of $\SU(N)$:
\be
    \fnorm{z} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{N-1}{N}} \; ,
     \quad z\in \zentrum,\; z\ne\mathbb{I} \; .
\eq
One can use this to define a norm for an entire
lattice configuration:
\be
   \fnorm{\config} =
   \sqrt{\frac{1}{V_L D} \sum_{\mu,x} \fnorm{U_\mu(x)}^2}
   \; . \label{latnorm2}
\eq
%
%and the distance between two lattice configurations,
%\be
%   \left\langle \config, \config^\prime \right\rangle_2 =
%   \sqrt{\frac{1}{V_L D} \sum_{\mu,x} \fnorm{U_\mu^\dagger(x)
%     U_\mu^\prime(x)}^2} \; .
%\eq
%The distance metric should not be taken too seriously, 
%since it is not gauge invarient.
%
We can also define a link norm modulo the center $\zentrum$,
\be
\left\lVert U_\mu(x) \right\rVert_\zentrum =
    \min_{z\in \zentrum} \fnorm{z U_\mu(x)} \; .
\eq
That is, $\left\lVert U_\mu(x) \right\rVert_\zentrum$ is the distance
of $U_\mu(x)$ from the nearest element of $\zentrum$.
Analogous to Eqn.~(\ref{latnorm2}), we can
use $\left\lVert U_\mu(x) \right\rVert_\zentrum$ to define
the associated lattice norm
\be
    \left\lVert \config \right\rVert_\zentrum =
\sqrt{\frac{1}{V_L D} \sum_{\mu,x}
  \left\lVert U_\mu(x) \right\rVert_\zentrum^2}
   \; . \label{latnormz}
\eq

\section{Observables}

We will use Polyakov loops and Wilson loops to monitor the
behavior of the gauge fields when moving from
the original Euclidean lattice configuration toward
a saddle-point.  The goal here is not to make precise
measurements of the string tension and glueball spectra
but to probe the qualitative behavior for just a single
lattice configuration.

As we move toward the saddle-point of a lattice configuration,
we expect that the perturbative (quantum) fluctuations of
the gauge field to change greatly.  It is not clear how the
standard strategies for improving lattice
operators~\cite{teper_$mathrmsun$_1998,lucini_glueballs_2004}
might behave during this process.  We will not tackle that
issue in the present investigation, but will stick to the bare
(unimproved) operators.

\subsection{Coulomb corrections}

In $D=4$ spacetime directions, there is a clear separation---both
experimentally and in lattice calculations---between a
short distance regime where the heavy quark potential is
dominated by a $1/r$ Coulomb force potential and a
long-distance regime having a linear confining
potential~\cite{bali_static_2000,brambilla_effective-field_2005}.
In $D=3$, the Coulomb potential goes as $\log(r)$ and there is no 
clear separation and some care must be taken to distinguish it from
the linear confining potential.

If we consider a pair of charges separated by some
distance $r$ at some instant in time, the Coulomb potential is
equal to the energy stored in the electric
field produced by those charges (electrostatics in $D-1$
dimensions).  Equivalently, we can consider currents
in $D$ Euclidean spacetime dimensions.  In that case,
the classical action is equal to the
energy of the magnetic field produced by those currents
(magnetostatics in $D$ dimensions).  Using the textbook
formula~\cite{jackson_classical_1975}
for the magnetostatic energy associated with a current density
$\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x})$,
%
\be
S = \frac{1}{2} \int d^3\mathbf{x}\, d^3\mathbf{x}^\prime\,
\frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}) \cdot
  \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}^\prime)}{
  \left| \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^\prime\right|} \, ,
\eq
%
we can find the action associated with a number of thin wires
carrying a constant current. (We set the current equal to 1 in
the following.)

In the case of two Polyakov loops with opposite currents separated
by distance $r$ with periodic boundary conditions, period $L$,
there is a self-energy term plus an interaction term:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
S_\Phi &=& 2 \int_0^L dx \int_{x+\varepsilon/2}^\infty dy
\left(\frac{1}{y-x} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{(y-x)^2 + r^2}}\right) \\
  &=& 2 L \log\left(\frac{r}{\varepsilon}\right) + O(\varepsilon)\, .
\end{eqnarray}
%
Thus, we obtain the usual $L \log(r)$ term plus a
self-energy term proportional to the length
of the currents, $2L$.  The $\log(\varepsilon)$ divergence
is from approximating the current density as a thin wire.
Since the normalization
of this field relative to the bare link fields is
unknown, one can fit the Coulomb contribution to the
Polyakov loop correlator using
\be
       c_q 2 L \log(r) + c_p 2 L \, , \label{cpf}
\eq
where $c_q$ and $c_p$ are unknown.

In the case of a $w_1\times w_2$ Wilson loop, we obtain
a more complicated expression
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  S_W &=& 2 \int_0^{w_1} dx \int_{x+\varepsilon}^{w_1} \frac{dx^\prime}{x^\prime-x}
               \nonumber\\
               & &  - \int_0^{w_1} dx \int_{0}^{w_1} \frac{dx^\prime}{
                 \sqrt{(x^\prime-x)^2+ w_2^2}}
               \nonumber\\
               & &  +\left[w_1 \leftrightarrow w_2 \right]\\
   &=&  2 \eta - 2 w_1 -2 w_2
               - 2 w_1 \log\left(\frac{\varepsilon\left(\eta +w_1\right)}{
                 w_1 w_2}\right)
               \nonumber\\
   & &  +\left[w_1 \leftrightarrow w_2\right] + O(\varepsilon) \, ,\\
\end{eqnarray}
where $\eta=\sqrt{w_1^2+w_2^2}$.  Similar the the above, 
we obtain a self-energy term that is proportional to the perimeter of
the rectangle.  Thus, we can fit the Coulomb
contribution to the Wilson loop using
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \mathcal{S}_{w_1\times w_2}\left(c_q, c_p\right) & = &
     c_q 2 \left(\eta
        -  w_1 - w_2
        -  w_1 \log\left(\frac{\eta +w_1}{w_1 w_2}\right)
        + \left[w_1 \leftrightarrow w_2\right]\right)
        \nonumber\\ 
 &&  + c_p  2\left(w_1+w_2\right)  \label{cwf}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $c_p$ and $c_q$ in Eqns.~(\ref{cpf}) and (\ref{cwf})
should be equivalent.

\subsection{Polyakov Loops}

Let us define a Polyakov loop that winds once around the lattice
in the direction $\mu$ and goes through site $x$:
\be
         \phi_\mu(x)= \prod_{\rho=1}^L U_\mu(x+a \hat{\mu} \rho)
\eq
and define the correlator:
\be
\Phi_\mu(r) = \frac{1}{C_\Phi} \sum_{x, x_\mu=1} \sum_{y, y_\mu=1}
           \delta_{r,|x-y|}
           \langle 0 | \frac{1}{N} \Tr\left(\phi_\mu^\dagger(y)\right)
           \frac{1}{N} \Tr\left(\phi_\mu(x)\right) |0\rangle
           \label{pcorr}
\eq
%
where the normalization constant $C_\Phi$ is chosen such that
$\Phi_\mu(r)=1$ for the bare vacuum.  To obtain the string tension,
we fit the correlator $\Phi_\mu(r)$ to an effective potential $F_\mu(r)$.
This effective potential contains an area law term (linear confinement)
plus coulomb corrections from Eqn.~(\ref{cpf}) plus power law corrections:
%  M. Teper, “Large N and confining flux tubes as strings -
%  a view from the lattice,”
%  Acta Phys. Polon. B 40, 3249 (2009). [arXiv:0912.3339 [hep-lat]].
%
\begin{eqnarray}
         F_\mu(r) &=& c_0 \exp\left(
         -\sigma a^2 r L_\mu
         - c_q 2 L_\mu \log(r) - c_p 2 L_\mu
         - c_1 \frac{L_\mu}{r} - c_2 \frac{r}{L_\mu} - \cdots \right)\nonumber\\
         & & + \left[\,\mbox{$2 (D-1)$ transverse images}\,\right]
         \; .  \label{stringmodel}
\end{eqnarray}
%
In the case of
a cube-shaped lattice $L_\mu = L$, the $c_p$ term can be absorbed into
the normalization constant $c_0$ and $c_2$ is indistinguishable from
the string tension.  If excited states are ignored, the $c_2$ term corresponds
to the Luscher correction~\cite{teper_large_2009}.
Since the lattices we use are relatively small, we include contributions
from fields wrapping around the lattice in the plane transverse to
$\hat{\mu}$.  Thus, we sum over the two closest images of the Polyakov
loop in each transverse direction.

This effective potential is, in principle, equivalent to the more
conventional sum over states plus finite longitudinal length
corrections~\cite{teper_large_2009,aharony_effective_2013}.
We use the effective potential form since we are interested in
the behavior over various transverse separations $r$, rather than
just the large $r$ limit.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{polycorr12-16-20}
  \caption{Polyakov loop correlator vs.\ loop area together with
    a fit to Eqn.~(\ref{stringmodel}) for $L_\mu r>23$.
    Each color represents a different Polyakov loop direction.
    The data is from 300 lattice configurations. \label{pcorr16}}
\end{figure}

When measuring $\Phi_\mu(r)$ for a single lattice configuration
the link fields are re-used for each value of $r$.  This means
that the loop correlators $\Phi_\mu(r)$ versus $r$ are not statistically
independent, compromising the $\chi^2$ fitting process.  To address this,
we calculate the sample covariance matrix $\mathcal{C}$:
\be
\mathcal{C}_{i, j} = \cov{\Phi_\mu(r_i)}{\Phi_\mu(r_j)} 
\eq
using $>300$ Euclidean Lattice Monte Carlo configurations, where
$\left\{r_1, r_2, \ldots\right\}$ is the set of possible transverse
separations.  Then, one can fit the correlators to the effective
potential using the standard formula:
\be
\chi^2 = \sum_{i,j} \left(\Phi_\mu(r_i) - F_\mu(r_i)\right)
               \left(\mathcal{C}^{-1}\right)_{i,j}
               \left(\Phi_\mu(r_j) - F_\mu(r_j)\right)
\eq

An example for an $\SU(3)$, $12\times 16 \times 20$
lattice, $\beta=28$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{pcorr16}.  The lattice configurations
were generated with the Chroma library~\cite{edwards_chroma_2005};
see Appendix~\ref{configurations} for details.
The string tension $\sigma a^2 = 0.0157(20)$
agrees with Teper's value for $\beta=28$,
$\sigma a^2 = 0.016210(54)$~\cite{lucini_$mathrmsun$_2002,athenodorou_sun_2017}.
The fit has $\chi^2=292$ for 223 degrees of freedom,
with the covariance matrix derived from 600 lattice configurations.
Also, the leading power-law corrections are rather small.
However, it should be noted that several model parameters,
$c_1$, $c_p$, and $c_q$ are highly correlated since
we don't have sufficient longitudinal values to distinguish
between them.  We also see that including the transverse
images of the Polyakov loop are important for the fit.

\subsection{Wilson loops}

Similarly, we define a Wilson loop operator using a product of
link fields lying on the perimeter of a rectangle having the given
dimensions:
\be
       \wilson{w_1}{w_2} = \frac{1}{C_W} \sum_{\mu \ne \nu, x}\,
         \underbrace{U_\mu(x) U_\mu(x+a \hat{\mu}) \,\cdots\, U_\nu^\dagger (x)
         }_{\mbox{$w_1\times w_2$ rectangle}}
\eq
with normalization $C_W$ chosen such that $\wilson{m}{n} = \mathbb{I}$
for the bare vacuum.  In this case, we can fit $\left\langle 0 \right|
\frac{1}{N} \Tr \wilson{w_1}{w_2} \left|0\right\rangle $ to an effective
potential containing a linearly confining term plus Coulomb terms
plus power law corrections:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
     W_{w_1,w_2} &=& c_0^\prime \exp\left(
     -\sigma a^2 w_1 w_2 - \mathcal{S}_{w_1\times w_2}\left(c_q, c_p\right)
     - c_2 \left(\frac{w_1}{w_2}+\frac{w_2}{w_1}\right) - \cdots
     \right)\nonumber\\
     & & + c_0^\prime \exp\left(
     -\sigma a^2 (L_1 L_2 - w_1 w_2) -
     \mathcal{S}_{w_1\times w_2}\left(c_q, c_p\right) - c_1\left(L_1 +L_2 - w_1 -w_2\right) - \cdots
     \right)\; .  \label{wfit}
\end{eqnarray}


\subsection{Operator distributions}

The quantity that is actually measured can be generalized, as well.
For some loop operator $\mathcal{O}\in\SU(N)$, one usually
measures the expectation value of the trace,
$\langle 0 | \frac{1}{N} \Tr \mathcal{O} |0\rangle$, or for $k$-strings,
one measures expectation values of higher order operators
like $\Tr\left( \mathcal{O}^k\right)$.
However, this is not the most general gauge-invariant observable.
The most general physical observable is the distribution of the
eigenvalues of $\mathcal{O}$.  If $e^{i\lambda_1}$,\ldots, $e^{i\lambda_N}$
are the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{O}$, we can order $\lambda_j$ in
some fashion $\lambda_1\ge \lambda_2 \ge \ldots$ and demand that
$\lambda_j-\lambda_k\le 2\pi$ (see Appendix~\ref{roots}).
In that case, physically
distinct values lie on an ($N-1$)-simplex with the elements of the
center of $\SU(N)$ at the vertices.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{polydist1}
  \includegraphics{polydistr}
  \caption{Distribution for the Wilson loop operator
    $wilson_{5\times 5}$ for $\SU(3)$, $\beta=28$, $L^3=16^3$,
    averaging over 100 lattice configurations.
    Also shown is the distribution for the strong coupling limit.
    The distribution is
    symmetric under charge conjugation,
    % $2 \lambda_1 +\lambda_2 \to 2 \lambda_1 +\lambda_2 $,
    $\lambda_2 \to -\lambda_2$.
   \label{polydist1}}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{polydist2}
  \caption{Distribution for $\Tr wilson_{5\times 5}/N$  for
    the data shown in Fig.~\ref{polydist1}.  
    The distribution is symmetric under complex conjugation,
    $\mathcal{O}\to\mathcal{O}^\dagger$.
    The distribution lies inside the blue lines representing
    the edges of the triangle in Fig.~\ref{polydist1}.
    \label{polydist2}}
\end{figure}

By way of example, we show the distribution of the
$5\times5$ Wilson loop operator for $\SU(3)$ in Fig.~\ref{polydist1}.
For comparison, we also show the distribution for
the strong coupling limit (random $\SU(N)$ matrices).
Notice that the shape of the two distributions appear to
be quite similar, except that the $\wilson{5}{5}$ distribution
is shifted toward $\mathbb{I}$, reflecting the fact that
$\langle\Tr \wilson{5}{5}\rangle >0$.

We can relate the distribution in $\lambda_j$-space to the
distribution of $\Tr\mathcal{O}$.
For $\SU(2)$, $\Tr \mathcal{O}$ is real and for $\SU(3)$, $\Tr \mathcal{O}$
is complex.  In both cases, the map from the $\lambda_j$-space to
$\Tr \mathcal{O}$ is injective and one can just as well look at the
distribution of $\Tr \mathcal{O}$; see Fig.~\ref{polydist2}.
However, for $N>3$, information is lost when taking the trace
of $\mathcal{O}$.

\section{Landau gauge}

In the continuum, the choice of Landau gauge $\partial_\mu A^\mu = 0$
is equivalent to minimizing $\Tr A_\mu A^\mu$ over all space.  The fact that
$\partial_\mu A^\mu = 0$ has multiple solutions (the Gribov problem) is
equivalent to the statement that $\Tr A_\mu A^\mu$, integrated over space,
has multiple local minima.~\cite{maas_more_2009}.
We are interested here in Landau gauge mainly
because it gives us, if $\Tr A_\mu A^\mu$ is small enough, the
hope of connecting the lattice
link fields to the continuum degrees of freedom.
On the lattice, this is equivalent to finding a gauge transform
that minimizes the lattice norm $\fnorm{\config}$.  In this
section, we will explore some strategies for finding this minimum.

Let us start with local minimization.
For some site $x$, we want to find a gauge transform $U_G$ on $x$
that minimizes $\fnorm{U_\mu(x)}$ for the $2D$
links connected to $x$.  Taylor expanding in the link fields,
we find, to lowest order in the fields, a gauge transform
that minimizes this norm:
%
\be
          U_G(x) = e^{- \overline{M}}
\eq
where
\be
   \overline{M} = \frac{\orelax}{2 D} \sum_\mu \log\left(U_\mu(x)\right) -
   \log(U_\mu\left(x-a \hat{\mu})\right)  \; . \label{landau}
\eq
At each site of the lattice, one can calculate $U_G(x)$ and apply it,
moving through the lattice sites in a checkerboard fashion,
first all the even sites and then all the odd sites.
This constitutes one minimization step, a ``Landau step,'' in a
successive over-relaxation (SOR) procedure.
The relaxation factor $\orelax$ can be adjusted to speed numerical
convergence.
In practice, we find the fastest convergence for $\orelax \approx 1.7$;
however, it can become unstable for slightly higher $\orelax$.
We generally use $\orelax=1.5$ as a compromise between speed and stability.

A variation of this procedure would be to minimize
$\left\lVert \config \right\rVert_\zentrum$ instead.
That is, we minimize the norm of the link
fields modulo some element of the center of $\SU(N)$, a ``center step.''
In this case, we find a gauge transform $U_G$ on $x$
that minimizes $\left\lVert U_\mu(x) \right\rVert_\zentrum$ for the $2D$
links connected to $x$.
That is, when computing the logarithms in Eqn.~(\ref{landau}) one uses
\be
\log\left(U_\mu(x)\right) \to \log\left(z^k U_\mu(x)\right)
\, , \;\mbox{
  where $z^k\in\zentrum$ minimizes}\; \fnorm{z^k U_\mu(x)} \;.

\subsection{Maximal center gauge}

Although maximal center gauge~\cite{del_debbio_center_1997}
has been an important topic in the
literature~\cite{greensite_confinement_2003},
we will not consider it separately from Landau gauge.
This section explains why and introduces our best algorithm
for finding Landau gauge.

  \end{table}

On the lattice, maximal center gauge corresponds
to a gauge transform that minimizes
$\left\lVert \config \right\rVert_\zentrum$. 
If we apply some number of ``center steps,'' defined above,
to a lattice configuration, we find quick convergence to some local
minimum of $\left\lVert \config \right\rVert_\zentrum$ with
link fields distributed fairly evenly across $\zentrum$.
See Table~\ref{center1} for an example.

However, this procedure fails to remove long-range field fluctuations
associated with the random choice of gauge.  We can remove
such fluctuations by another gauge choice:  axial gauge
$\partial_\mu A_\mu = 0$ (no sum on $\mu$).
That is, for direction $\mu$, we choose a gauge such that $U_\mu(x)$
is replaced by the $L_\mu^\mathrm{th}$ root of the associated Polyakov loop,
$U_\mu(x) \to \phi_\mu(x)^{1/L_\mu}$ where the root is defined in
Appendix~\ref{roots}.
% While not a complete gauge fixing, this gauge choice does
% remove most long-scale fluctuations caused by the
% gauge choice itself.
This gauge choice minimizes $\fnorm{U_\mu(x)}$
on the link fields in $\phi_\mu(x)$.  One might
object that this minimization is not appropriate for maximal center gauge
since it preferentially minimizes the link fields
with respect to $\mathbb{I}$ and not some other element of $\zentrum$.
This leads us to a variation which we will call ``$\zentrum$-axial gauge''
where we instead minimize $\left\lVert U_\mu(x) \right\rVert_\zentrum$
for the link fields in $\phi_\mu(x)$.  In Table~\ref{center2},
we apply this gauge transform in each direction before applying
some number of local minimizations.  One can see that this
results in a substantially improved lattice norm relative to
Table~\ref{center1}.  We also see that the link fields
remain relatively evenly distributed over the elements of $\zentrum$.

But is $\zentrum$-axial gauge actually an improvement over
conventional axial gauge?
In Table~\ref{center3}, we apply axial gauge in each
direction before applying some number of ``center steps.''
We see that this produces a lattice norm that is, in fact,
substantially lower than before.  We also can see, since
axial gauge preferentially minimizes $U_\mu(x)$ with
respect to $\mathbb{I}$, substantially more links lie near
the identity element.

Can we do better? Let us include some number of ``Landau steps''
in the procedure; see Table~\ref{center4}.  (The strategy shown
here was the end result of a an extensive Monte Carlo study that
included a number of other gauge fixing strategies, as well.)
We see a substantially reduced lattice norm, relative to
Table~\ref{center3}.  We also see that virtually all the
links are closest to identity element.  Thus, this procedure
minimizes both $\left\lVert \config\right\rVert_\zentrum$ and
$\fnorm{\config}$.
We won't give details here, but similar calculations for
$\SU(2)$ and $\SU(4)$ produce comparable results.
In conclusion, we find evidence that, for $D=3$,
``absolute'' maximal center gauge is identical to ``absolute''
Landau gauge (using the language of Ref.~\cite{maas_more_2009});
Table~\ref{center4} gives
an effective strategy for finding the associated minimum.

This analysis casts doubt on the various lattice studies involving
maximal center gauge and center projections~\cite{
del_debbio_center_1997,del_debbio_detection_1998,de_forcrand_relevance_1999}.
Presumably, in these studies, relatively large local minima of
$\left\lVert \config \right\rVert_\zentrum$ were being investigated
rather than configurations near a global minimum.


\subsection{Newton's method minimization}

We introduce a final strategy for finding Landau gauge:
Newton's method.  Here, we find a gauge transform, Eqn.~(\ref{gauget}),
that minimizes the lattice norm squared $\sum_{\mu,x}\fnorm{U_\mu^\prime(x)}^2$
as a function of $B_a(x)$,
where $U_G(x) = \exp\left(i B_a(x)\, T_a\right)$.
We construct the the gradient and hessian matrices
and solve the associated linear system to find a local minimum of
$\fnorm{\config}^2$.
Details of this method can be found in Appendix~\ref{newtonNorm}.

How, does this method compare with the much simpler ``Landau step'' defined
earlier?  In a ``Landau step'' we minimize the fields in the tangent space
of the gauge group, which can be justified if the gauge fields are small.
In Newton's method, we assume the gauge transform is small, but
assume nothing about the gauge fields.

In practice, we find that Newton's method performs well in the
vicinity of a local minimum of $\fnorm{\config}^2$.
The convergence of ``Landau step'' is slower, but is less susceptible
to getting stuck in a non-optimal local minimum.  In addition,
the ``Landau step'' requires significantly fewer computational resources.

Thus, when minimizing $\fnorm{\config}^2$, we will mostly rely
on ``Landau steps'' and apply 2-3 Newton's method steps at the very end,
when already close to the minimum.

\section{Finding the saddle point}
\label{saddlePoint}

In the following, we will introduce an iterative
procedure---Newton's method---for finding the saddle-point
of the action associated with a single lattice configuration.

\subsection{Shifts of the gauge fields}

  \end{array}
  \]
  \caption{One can think of a shift as applying a color rotation
    to the middle of a lattice link. \label{shift}}
\end{figure}

In order to find a saddle point, it is convenient to modify
the link fields $U_\mu(x)$ in a manner that maintains lattice symmetries.
We define a ``shift'' for each link as
\be
  U_\mu(x) \to \sqrt{U_\mu(x)}\, e^{i w_{a}(\mu, x) T_a}\, \sqrt{U_\mu(x)} \; ,
    \label{shifts}
\eq
where $T_a$ are generators of $\SU(N)$, with normalization
$\delta_{a,b} = 2 \Tr(T_a T_b)$ and the square root is defined
in Appendix~\ref{roots}.
We can then take partial derivatives of $N S/\beta$ with
respect to the $n_L$ shifts $\mathbf{w} = \left(w_1(1, x_1), \ldots\right)$
to obtain the gradient vector $\mathbf{q}$ and Hessian matrix
$H$.  The gradient and Hessian can be used to estimate the
position of the nearest saddle point.

Let us consider the gradient for the link $U_\mu(x)$.
The gradient will involve the $2 (D-1)$ plaquettes that include that link.
Let $F_\mu(x)$ be the associated sum of staples; then
\be
   \frac{N}{\beta} \frac{\partial S}{\partial w_a(\mu, x)} =
   \Im\Tr\left(F_\mu(x) \sqrt{U_\mu(x)} T_a \sqrt{U_\mu(x)}\right) \; .
   \label{grad}
\eq
We can use Eqn.~(\ref{grad}) to construct the gradient vector $\mathbf{q}$.
Likewise, one can calculate the $n_L\times n_L$ Hessian matrix
$H$ from
\be
      \frac{N}{\beta} \frac{\partial^2 S}{\partial w_a(\mu, x)\, \partial w_b(\nu, y)}
\eq
which is nonzero when there is a plaquette which contains both
$U_\mu(x)$ and $U_\nu(y)$.
The full calculation of $H$ is rather lengthy and we will not bore the reader
with the details.

Some shifts $\mathbf{w}$ correspond to gauge transforms.
As we shall see, such shifts are problematic for any saddle
point search, since the action is constant in those directions.
To address this issue, we determine the set of shifts that are
equivalent to infinitesimal gauge transforms.  Consider a gauge transform
at site $x$; its action on link $U_\mu(x)$ is:
\be
U_\mu(x) \to e^{i C_a(x) T_a} U_\mu(x) = U_\mu(x) + i C_a(x) T_a U_\mu(x) +
       \mathrm{O}\!\left(C_a^2\right)
\eq
But this is equal to some infinitesimal shift $w_a(\mu, x)$ on
the same link $U_\mu(x)$:
\be
U_\mu(x) \to U_\mu(x) + i w_a(\mu,x) \sqrt{U_\mu(x)}T_a \sqrt{U_\mu(x)} +
       \mathrm{O}\!\left(w_a^2\right)
\eq
%
Equating the two and taking the trace:
\be
w_a(\mu,x) = 2 C_b(x) \Tr\left(\sqrt{U_\mu(x)} T_a
                     \sqrt{U_\mu^\da(x)} T_b\right) \; . \label{gs}
\eq
Using Eqn.~(\ref{gs}), one can construct an $n_G \times n_L$ matrix
$G$ that relates shifts to infinitesimal gauge transforms
at each lattice site.
Since the action is invariant under gauge transforms, $G \mathbf{q} = 0$.
However, since the Hessian represents the quadratic term, $G H G^T \neq 0$.

Since we are using the Hessian, we are approximating
the action $S$ as being quadratic in $\mathbf{w}$.  If $\mathbf{w}$
is too large, the quadratic approximation is no longer valid.
Thus, we need to monitor the size of the shifts.
Using Eqn.~(\ref{sunorm}), we will define two norms for the shifts:
a lattice-wide $\infty$-norm,
\be
\left\lVert \mathbf{w}\right\rVert_{\mathrm{max}} =
     \max_{x,\mu} \fnorm{e^{i w_{a}(\mu, x) T_a}}
     = \max_{x,\mu} \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\sum_a w_a^2(\mu, x)}
\eq
as well as a lattice-wide Euclidean norm, averaged over links
\be
\left\lVert \mathbf{w}\right\rVert_2 =
      \sqrt{\frac{1}{V_L D} \sum_{x, \mu}
        \fnorm{e^{i w_{a}(\mu, x) T_a}}^2}
     = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2 V_L D} \sum_{x, \mu, a} w_a^2(\mu, x)}
        \; .  \label{shiftsize}
\eq

\subsection{Calculating the saddle point}
\label{saddle}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{eigenAll}
\caption{Histogram of the eigenvalues of $H$ for a $6^3$ lattice,
  $\beta = 8.175$, $N=3$.  We see a peak around zero due to the
  $\SU(3)$ gauge symmetry.
  \label{eigenAll}}
\end{figure}

In principle, to find the nearest saddle point, one would
find $H$ and $\mathbf{q}$, solve the linear system
\be
    H \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{q} \label{linear1}
\eq
and shift the gauge fields using $\mathbf{w} = -\mathbf{y}$.
Since the action $S$ is not quadratic in $\mathbf{w}$, one
would then iterate this process to find the actual saddle point
(Newton's method).

However, in practice, this procedure does not work.  To see why, let us
look at the eigenvalues of $H$.  As seen in Figure~\ref{eigenAll},
we see that the eigenvalues are strongly peaked around zero,
due to the gauge symmetry of the theory.  Thus, the linear
system (\ref{linear1}) will be nearly singular and
the solution will be numerically unstable.  We must be more careful.

To address this issue, we find the null-space $P_G$ of the gauge
transform matrix $G$,
\be
G P_G^T = 0 \; , \quad P_G P_G^T = \mathbb{I}\; .
\eq
Then we project $H$ and $\mathbf{q}$ onto
the subspace of non-gauge-transform shifts:
\be
         H^\prime = P_G H P_G^T \quad \mbox{and} \quad
         \mathbf{q}^\prime = P_G \mathbf{q} \; .
\eq
Then we can solve the linear system
\be
   H^\prime \mathbf{y}^\prime = \mathbf{q}^\prime \label{linear2}
\eq
and set $\mathbf{w} = - P_G^T \mathbf{y}^\prime$.  However, this is
still insufficient to yield a well-behaved linear system.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{shiftPairs}
\caption{Scatter plot of eigenvalue-gradient pairs of $H^\prime$
  for a $6^3$ lattice, $\beta = 8.175$, $N=3$.  The pairs above the
  v-shaped wedge correspond to large shifts and will dominate
  the solution to the linear system, Eqn.~(\ref{linear2}).
  \label{shiftPairs}}
\end{figure}

To better understand this issue, let us find the eigenvalues
$\left(\heigen_1, \heigen_2, \ldots\right)$ and
eigenvectors $V=\left(\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots\right)$
of $H^\prime$ and express Eqn.~(\ref{linear2}) in the eigenspace of $H^\prime$:
\be
\begin{pmatrix}
    \heigen_1 & & \\
    & \heigen_2 & \\
    & & \ddots  \end{pmatrix} \overline{\mathbf{y}} =
  \overline{\mathbf{q}} \label{linear3}
\eq
where $\overline{\mathbf{y}} = V \mathbf{y}^\prime$ and
$\overline{\mathbf{q}}  = V \mathbf{q}^\prime$.
The solution is simply
\be
    \overline{y}_i = \frac{\overline{q}_i}{\heigen_i} \; .
\eq
In any case where $\left|\heigen_i\right|\ll
\left|\overline{q}_i\right|$,
there will be a large shift that will dominate the solution
to the linear system.
Thus, we impose cutoffs $\Lambda_2$ and $\Lambda_\mathrm{max}$:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \sqrt{2} \left|\overline{q}_i\right|\left\lVert P_G^T \mathbf{v}_i\right\rVert_2
     &<& \left|\heigen_i\right|\,\Lambda_2 \label{lambda2} \\
    \sqrt{2} \left|\overline{q}_i\right|
      \left\lVert P_G^T \mathbf{v}_i\right\rVert_\mathrm{max}
    &<& \left|\heigen_i\right|\,\Lambda_\mathrm{max} \; .
\end{eqnarray}
%
and set $\overline{y}_i=0$ whenever a cutoff is violated.
That is, we remove any eigenpairs inside a v-shaped
region like the one shown in Fig.~\ref{shiftPairs}.  

Finally, since the gauge symmetry of the action is non-linear,
we do not want to shift the fields by too much before recalculating
the matrix $G$.  
Thus, it is useful to add a damping factor $\gamma$ and
further rescale by $\Lambda_s$ when the shift would
otherwise be large:
\be
  \mathbf{w} = - \gamma \mathbf{y} \min\left(1, \frac{\Lambda_s}{
    \sqrt{2} \left\lVert \mathbf{y}\right\rVert_\mathrm{max}}\right) \; .
\eq
Typically, $\Lambda_s = 1$ or $2$ is used.

Armed with these three tools:  removing infinitesimal-gauge-transform shifts,
imposing the $\Lambda$ cutoffs, and using the damping factor $\gamma$,
we can apply the shift iteratively and find saddle-point configurations
that are of physical interest.


\section{Trajectories}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{trajectory3}
\caption{Several trajectories are shown for a $16^3$ lattice configuration,
  $N=3$, $\beta=28$.
  The starting configuration $\config_0$ was generated using standard Euclidean
  Lattice Monte Carlo;
  {\bf 2b} was generated with $\gamma=0.1$, $\Lambda_\mathrm{max} = 2$,
  and $\Lambda_2=0.04434$;
  {\bf 2c} was generated with $\gamma=0.5$, $\Lambda_\mathrm{max} = 2$,

  and a shift
  was applied to a link when $\left\lVert\mathbf{w}\right\rVert<0.327$.
  \label{trajectory3}}
\end{figure}
  
We will apply our procedure to $\SU(3)$, $16 \times 20 \times 24$
and $14 \times 18 \times 22$ lattice
configurations, as well as a $\SU(4)$, $12 \times 16 \times 20$ lattice
configuration.  Details of the numerical calculation
are discussed in Appendices~\ref{krylov} and \ref{configurations}.

By applying the procedure discussed in Section~\ref{saddle} iteratively,
we produce a trajectory of lattice configurations $\config_0$,
$\config_1$, \ldots in configuration space.  For lattice configuration
$\config_\kappa$, we define
$\Delta_\kappa$ to be the total distance traveled through configuration
space
\be
\Delta_\kappa = \sum_{\rho=1}^\kappa \left\lVert \mathbf{w}_\rho\right\rVert_2
\eq
where $\mathbf{w}_\rho$ is the shift used to generate $\config_\rho$
from $\config_{\rho-1}$ and the norm is from Eqn.~(\ref{shiftsize}).
In Fig.~\ref{trajectory3}, we show some trajectories
in terms of $\Delta_\kappa$ and the string tension  $\sigma a^2$.

Lucini and Teper report a string tension $\sigma a^2=0.016282(76)$
for $N=3$, and $\beta=28$ (Ref.~\cite{lucini_$mathrmsun$_2002}, Table~5).
For the initial configuration $\config_0$ used in Fig.\ref{trajectory3},
we measure $\sigma a^2=0.0155(56)$;
with errors that remain about that size for $\config_\kappa$, $\kappa>0$.
For $\config_0$, $\plaquette_\mathrm{avg}=0.902$ and the
action is dominated by perturbative fluctuations of the gauge fields.
One can use the string tension to
estimate $\plaquette_\mathrm{avg}$ where we expect the action to become
dominated by the string-like behavior of the theory:
\be
\plaquette_\mathrm{avg} \gtrsim  1 - \sigma a^2 = 0.984 \; .
\eq


Ideally, $\plaquette_\mathrm{avg}$ will increase steadily and the string tension will remain relatively constant as we apply our iterative procedure.
This is illustrated by the trajectory {\bf 2d}.
In cases where $\gamma$ or $\Lambda_2$ is too large, we find that the
string tension does not remain stable, as illustrated by
trajectories {\bf 2b} and {\bf 2c}.

We also have investigated an ad-hoc procedure where
the off-diagonal color blocks of $H$ are dropped (that is, the
saddle point search is applied to each link individually).
This procedure is much easier to apply numerically.
As shown in trajectory {\bf lc},
we see that that the string tension can remain relatively stable,
but $\config_\kappa$ eventually degrades to the trivial vacuum.

  finish $\SU(3)$, $L^3=20^3$ calculation and
  add results for $\SU(4)$}

\subsection{gauge invariance}

{\bf Either give an example or delete }

The procedure described above is not gauge invariant.
However, in our numerical calculations we do see approximate
gauge invariance in the following
sense.  Starting with a gauge configuration $\config_0$ generated
by Euclidean lattice Monte Carlo, one can
use our procedure to generate a trajectory of configurations
$\config_1$, $\config_2$, \ldots
with distances $\Delta_1$, $\Delta_2$, \ldots.
If one first performs a gauge transform on the initial
configuration $\config_0 \to \config_0^\prime$ and then generates a
new trajectory $\config_1^\prime$, $\config_2^\prime$, \ldots
with distance $\Delta_\kappa^\prime$,
gauge invariant observables
measured for $\config_\kappa$ and $\config_\kappa^\prime$ are approximately equal.
Moreover,  $\Delta_\kappa \approx \Delta_\kappa^\prime$.

     for the lowest $0^{++}$ glueball.
     We do not see the desired exponential behavior.
  \label{corrLink995}}
\end{figure}

We can look at other properties of the gauge configuration
as we move along the trajectory.  In particular, let us look
at the correlators of the charge conjugation even plaquette operator
\be
  \left\langle
  \left(\Re \plaquette_{\mu,\nu}(x) - \plaquette_\mathrm{avg}\right)
  \left(\Re \plaquette_{\alpha,\beta}(y) - \plaquette_\mathrm{avg}\right)
  \right\rangle
\eq
as a function of the separation of the two plaquettes
\be
\mathrm{separation} =
        \left\lVert \left(x+a \hat{\mu}/2+ a\hat{\nu}/2\right) -
             \left(y+a \hat{\alpha}/2+ a\hat{\beta}/2\right)
             \right\rVert \; .
\eq
This correlator couples to the $0^{++}$ glueball states.

In Fig.~\ref{corr2dEven}, we plot the correlation for various relative
orientations of the two plaquettes for several points along the
best trajectory in~\ref{trajectory3}.  We also plot an exponential
corresponding to Teper's value for the $0^{++}$ glueball,
mass $0.5517(38)/a$ for $\beta=28$, $L^3=23^3$~\cite{teper_$mathrmsun$_1998}.
The exponential only demonstrates that there is qualitative agreement.
Since the correlator also has contributions from the excited $0^{++}$
states, a quantitative fit would require a more extensive analysis,
with additional operators in the correlation function.  However, one
would expect the single plaquette operator to couple very strongly
to the lowest state and not so strongly to the excited states.

Likewise, we can look at the charge conjugation odd correlator
\be
  \left\langle
  \left(\Im \plaquette_{\mu,\nu}(x) - \plaquette_\mathrm{avg}\right)
  \left(\Im \plaquette_{\alpha,\beta}(y) - \plaquette_\mathrm{avg}\right)
  \right\rangle   \; ,
\eq
corresponding to the $0^{--}$ glueball states; see Fig.~\ref{corr2dOdd}.
Also shown is an exponential corresponding to the lowest $0^{--}$ state,
mass $0.8133(57)/a$ \cite{teper_$mathrmsun$_1998}.

In the case where the off-diagonal color blocks of $H$ are dropped,
we do not see the desired exponential behavior in the correlator,
Fig.~\ref{corrLink995}.

\section{Gauge Fields}



\section{Conclusions}

The master field idea is a statement about the $N\to \infty$ limit
of $\SU(N)$ gauge theory.  However, if finite $N$ is similar
to the $N\to\infty$ limit, we should expect that properties of
the master field emerge, approximately, at finite $N$.
As an example of this, we
see that a saddle point of a single lattice configuration
contains the necessary physics, at least approximately, to produce the
correct low-energy spectrum of the theory, string tensions,
and Wilson loop expectation values.

In addition, we see

\section{Roots of $\SU(N)$ matrices}
\label{roots}

In general, for matrix $U_c$ belonging to a connected Lie group,
the matrix power $U_c^t$, $t\in[0,1]$ should be a
smooth map from $[0,1]$ onto the group manifold where
$U_c^0=\mathbb{I}$, $U_c^1=U_c$, and $U_c^s U_c^t = U_c^{s+t}$;
the image of the map should have minimal length.
A unitary matrix $U$ can be factored as
%
\be
U = V \begin{pmatrix}
    \mathrm{e}^{i \lambda_1} & & &\\
    & \mathrm{e}^{i \lambda_2} & &\\
    & & \ddots & \\
    & & & \mathrm{e}^{i \lambda_N}\end{pmatrix} V^\da
\eq
%
where $V$ is a unitary matrix and $-\pi < \lambda_i < \pi$.
In the special case $U \in \SU(N)$, the $\det(U)=1$ condition implies that
\be
\sum_j \lambda_j = 2 \pi m\;, \quad m\in\integer \;.
\eq
When taking matrix roots, cases where $m\neq 0$ present a
difficulty.  However, one can always shift $\lambda_j$ by
multiples of $2\pi$:
\be
\lambda_j \to \lambda_j^\prime = \lambda_j + 2 \pi n_j\;,\quad
n_j\in\integer \; ,
\eq
such that $\sum_j \lambda_j^\prime = 0$ and
$\lambda_j^\prime - \lambda_k^\prime \le 2 \pi$.
%
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{hex3}
\caption{In the case of $\SU(3)$, $(\lambda_1^\prime,\lambda_2^\prime)$
  lie in the shaded hexagonal region.
  Elements of the center of the group $z$, $z^2$, lie on the vertices
  of the hexagon with the identity at the origin.
  The six triangular regions correspond to permutations of
  $\lambda_1^\prime$, $\lambda_2^\prime$, $\lambda_3^\prime$.   \label{hexagon}}
\end{figure}
%
The $\SU(3)$ case is shown in Fig.~\ref{hexagon}.
Using $\lambda_j^\prime$, we define $U^t$ as:
\be
U^t = V \begin{pmatrix}
    \mathrm{e}^{i\lambda_1^\prime t} & & &\\
    & \mathrm{e}^{i\lambda_2^\prime t} & &\\
    & & \ddots & \\
    & & & \mathrm{e}^{i\lambda_N^\prime t}\end{pmatrix} V^\da \; .
\eq
This definition of $U^t$ fulfills the conditions listed above.
Similarly, we define the logarithm of $U$ as:
\be
\log U = i V \begin{pmatrix}
    \lambda_1^\prime & & &\\
    & \lambda_2^\prime & &\\
    & & \ddots & \\
    & & & \lambda_N^\prime\end{pmatrix} V^\da \; .
\eq
Thus, the norm defined in Eqn.~(\ref{sunorm}) is simply
\be
\fnorm{U} = \sqrt{\sum_j {\lambda_j^\prime}^2} \; .
\eq


\section{Solving a constrained linear system}
\label{krylov}

For lattices of interest, the basis size $n_L$ is large enough
that direct solution is not possible and one must resort to Krylov
space methods (sparse matrix methods).
The Hessian matrix $H$ is sparse, with an $(N^2-1)\times(N^2-1)$
color block structure and $6D-5$ nonzero blocks per row/column.
The gauge transform matrix $G$ has the same color block structure
with $2 D$ nonzero blocks per row and $2$ nonzero blocks per column.

In order to preserve the sparsity of the matrices, we never
explicitly construct the space of non-transform shifts used in
Eqn.~(\ref{linear2}).  Instead, we apply the projection
operator $P_G$ to any Krylov space vector $\mathbf{v}$ using:
\be
    P_G \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} - G^T \mathbf{u} \; ,
\eq
where $\mathbf{u}$ is a solution of the linear system
\be
  G G^T \mathbf{u} = G \mathbf{v} \; .\label{gcg}
\eq
Eqn.~(\ref{gcg}) is solved using the conjugate gradient
algorithm, subroutine MINRES-QLP~\cite{choi_algorithm_2014}.
The matrix $G G^T$ is well-conditioned, so this typically converges
in less than 40 steps.

We use the Lanczos library nu-TRLan~\cite{yamazaki_adaptive_2010},
modified so that $P_G$ is applied to any Krylov space vector, to
find the smallest eigenpairs of $\left(P_G H\right)^2$.  From these, we find
the eigenvectors $\left\{\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2, \ldots\right\}$
associated with eigenpairs $\left(\heigen_i^2, \mathbf{r}_i\right)$
that violate the $\Lambda$ cutoffs,
%
\begin{eqnarray}
   \frac{\sqrt{2}\, \mathbf{r}_i \mathbf{\cdot} \mathbf{q}
   \left\lVert \mathbf{r}_i\right\rVert_2}{\left|\heigen_i\right| }
     &>& \Lambda_2  \quad\mbox{or} \\
   \frac{\sqrt{2}\, \mathbf{r}_i\mathbf{\cdot} \mathbf{q}
   \left\lVert \mathbf{r}_i\right\rVert_\mathrm{max}}{\left|\heigen_i\right| }
     &>& \Lambda_\mathrm{max} \; .
\end{eqnarray}
%
To ensure that we have found all the eigenpairs that violate the cutoffs,
we may need to calculate as many as 2000 to 4000 of the lowest eigenpairs
in the Lanzos routine.  As one moves along a trajectory towards the
saddle point, the gradient vector decreases in magnitude and fewer eigenpairs
exceed the $\Lambda$ cutoffs.

Finally, we solve the linear system $H \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{q}$
using the conjugate gradient algorithm,
subroutine MINRES-QLP~\cite{choi_algorithm_2014}, modified so that
the projection operators $P_G$ and 
$\mathbb{I}- \sum_{i} \mathbf{r}_i \otimes \mathbf{r}_i$
are applied to any Krylov space vector.

\section{Lattice configurations}
\label{configurations}

Lattice configurations were generated using the Chroma
code~\cite{edwards_chroma_2005}.
For $N>3$ it was necessary to add partial pivoting~\cite{golub_matrix_1996}
to the Chroma routine that calculates matrix determinants.  We then
verified that Chroma-generated values of $\plaquette_\mathrm{avg}$ agree with
Teper's results~\cite{lucini_$mathrmsun$_2002} for $N=3,4$.

The lattice configurations were sampled after 10,000 thermalizing
steps, with 3000 steps between samples for results that use
multiple lattice configurations.  We used 4 over-relaxations steps
for every heat bath step.

\section{Newton's method for minimizing the lattice norm}
\label{newtonNorm}

Let us use Newton's method to find a gauge transform, Eqn.~(\ref{gauget}),
that minimizes the lattice norm squared $\sum_{\mu,x}\fnorm{U_\mu^\prime(x)}^2$
as a function of $B_a(x)$,
where $U_G(x) = \exp\left(i B_a(x)\, T_a\right)$.
The strategy employed here closely follows the strategy used to find
saddle-points of the action, Section~\ref{saddlePoint} and
Appendix~\ref{krylov}, with one important difference:  we are trying
to find a minimum, rather than a saddle-point.  The $n_G$ partial
derivatives
%
\be
   \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial_{B_b(y)}} \sum_{\mu,x}
   \fnorm{U_\mu^\prime(x)}^2\right|_{B_a(x)=0} =
   2 \Im \sum_\mu \Tr\left[T_b \log\left(U_\mu(y)\right)
             - \log\left(U_\mu(y-a\hat\mu)\right)T_b\right]
   \label{normGrad}
\eq
can be used to construct the gradient vector $\mathbf{q}$.
Likewise, one can calculate the $n_G\times n_G$ Hessian matrix
$H$ from
\be
   \left.\frac{\partial^2}{\partial_{B_b(y)}\partial_{B_c(z)}} \sum_{\mu,x}
         \fnorm{U_\mu^\prime(x)}^2\right|_{B_a(x)=0} \; .
\eq
which is nonzero when $y$ and $z$ are the same site or neighboring sites.
The full expression for $H$ is rather lengthy and
will not be given here.  Also, we construct a vector
$\mathbf{b} =  \left(B_1(x_1), \ldots \right)$ representing the
gauge transform.

As with the saddle point calculation, we define two
norms for the gauge transform:
a lattice-wide $\infty$-norm,
\be
\left\lVert U_G \right\rVert_{\mathrm{max}} =
     \max_{x} \fnorm{e^{i B_{a}(x) T_a}}
     = \max_{x} \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\sum_a B_a^2(x)}
\eq
as well as a lattice-wide Euclidean norm, averaged over sites
\be
\left\lVert U_G\right\rVert_2 =
      \sqrt{\frac{1}{V_L} \sum_{x}
        \fnorm{e^{i B_{a}(x) T_a}}^2}
     = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2 V_L} \sum_{x, a} B_a^2(x)}
        \; .  \label{normshiftsize}
\eq

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{normShiftPairs0}\\
\includegraphics{normShiftPairs1}
\caption{Scatter plot of eigenvalue-gradient pairs of $H^\prime$
  for a $6^3$ lattice, $\beta = 8.175$, $N=3$.
  The first plot is for a typical lattice configuration before any
  gauge fixing.  The second plot is for a lattice configuration
  after 3-axial gauge steps and 6 ``Landau steps'' have been
  applied.
  \label{normShiftPairs}}
\end{figure}

The lattice norm is invariant under global color rotations and
the gradient will be zero in those directions.
Thus, we introduce an $N\times n_G$ matrix $G$
representing $N$ infinitesmimal global color rotations.
We use the associated null-space operator $P_G$,
\be
G P_G^T = 0 \;, \quad P_G P_G^T = \mathbb{I} \; ,
\eq
to project $H$ and $\mathbf{q}$ onto
the space of non-global-color-rotation transforms:
\be
         H^\prime = P_G H P_G^T \quad \mbox{and} \quad
         \mathbf{q}^\prime = P_G \mathbf{q} \; .
\eq
%
Let $\mathbf{y}^\prime$ be a solution of the linear system
\be
   H^\prime \mathbf{y}^\prime = \mathbf{q}^\prime \label{normlinear2}
\eq
and define eigenvalues
$\left(\heigen_1, \heigen_2, \ldots\right)$ and
eigenvectors $V=\left(\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots\right)$
of $H^\prime$ and
define $\overline{\mathbf{y}} = V \mathbf{y}^\prime$ and
$\overline{\mathbf{q}}  = V \mathbf{q}^\prime$.
 In any case where $\left|\heigen_i\right|\ll
\left|\overline{q}_i\right|$,
there will be a large gauge transform that will dominate the solution
to the linear system.
Likewise $\heigen_i<0$ corresponds to a local maximum of the function.
Thus, we impose a cutoffs $\Lambda_2$ and $\Lambda_\mathrm{max}$:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \sqrt{2} \left|\overline{q}_i\right|\left\lVert P_G^T \mathbf{v}_i\right\rVert_2
     &<& \heigen_i \, \Lambda_2 \label{normlambda2}\\
    \sqrt{2} \left|\overline{q}_i\right|
      \left\lVert P_G^T \mathbf{v}_i\right\rVert_\mathrm{max}
    &<& \heigen_i\, \Lambda_\mathrm{max} \; .
\end{eqnarray}
%
and set $\overline{y}_i=0$ whenever a cutoff is violated.
That is, we remove any eigenpairs to the left
of the slanted line shown in Fig.~\ref{normShiftPairs}.
The resulting gauge transform is
\be
      \mathbf{b} = -P_G^T \left. V^T
                    \overline{\mathbf{y}}\right|_{\Lambda_2,\Lambda_\mathrm{max}} \; .
\eq
%
(Numerically, we find that including a damping factor does not
improve convergence.)

Looking a Fig.~\ref{normShiftPairs}, we see that for a random
gauge choice, $H^\prime$ has many
negative eigenvalues and one should
expect that Newton's method will work very poorly.
However, after some intial minimization of the lattice
norm, we see that very few---if any---eigenvalues violate the cutoffs
and Newton's method should work quite well.
