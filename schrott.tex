The quantity that is actually measured can be generalized, as well.
For some loop operator $\mathcal{O}\in\SU(N)$, one usually
measures the expectation value of the trace,
$\langle 0 | \Tr \mathcal{O} |0\rangle$, or for $k$-strings,
one measures expectation values of higher order operators
like $\Tr\left( \mathcal{O}^k\right)$.
However, this is not the most general gauge-invariant observable.
The most general physical observable is the distribution of the
eigenvalues of $\mathcal{O}$.  If $e^{i\lambda_1}$,\ldots, $e^{i\lambda_N}$
are the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{O}$, we can order $\lambda_j$ in
some fashion $\lambda_1\ge \lambda_2 \ge \ldots$ and demand that
$\lambda_j-\lambda_k\le 2\pi$ (see Appendix~\ref{roots}).
In that case, physically
distinct values lie on an ($N-1$)-simplex with the elements of the
center of $\SU(N)$ at the vertices.

By way of example, we show the distribution of the
$5\times5$ Wilson loop operator for $\SU(3)$ in Fig.~\ref{polydist1}.
For comparison, we also show the distribution for
the strong coupling limit (random $\SU(N)$ matrices).
Notice that the shape of the two distributions appear to
be quite similar, except that the $\wilson{\mu}{\nu}{5}{5}$ distribution
is shifted toward $\mathbb{I}$, reflecting the fact that
$\langle\Tr \wilson{\mu}{\nu}{5}{5}\rangle >0$.

% We can relate the distribution in $\lambda_j$-space to the
% distribution of $\Tr\mathcal{O}$.
% For $\SU(2)$, $\Tr \mathcal{O}$ is real and for $\SU(3)$, $\Tr \mathcal{O}$
% is complex.  In both cases, the map from the $\lambda_j$-space to
% $\Tr \mathcal{O}$ is injective and one can just as well look at the
% distribution of $\Tr \mathcal{O}$; see Fig.~\ref{polydist2}.
% However, for $N>3$, information is lost when taking the trace
% of $\mathcal{O}$.


\section{Coulomb corrections}
\label{coulomb}

In $D=4$ spacetime directions, there is a clear separation---both
experimentally and in lattice calculations---between a
short distance regime where the heavy quark potential is
dominated by a $1/r$ Coulomb force potential and a
long-distance regime having a linear confining
potential~\cite{bali_static_2000,brambilla_effective-field_2005}.
In $D=3$, the Coulomb potential goes as $\log(r)$ and distinguishing
it from the linear confining potential is more difficult.
In this section, we derive
the functional form of the Coulomb contribution to
the effective potential for Polyakov loop correlators and Wilson
loops.

If we consider a pair of charges separated by some
distance $r$ at some instant in time, the Coulomb potential is
equal to the energy stored in the electric
field produced by those charges (electrostatics in $D-1$
dimensions).  Equivalently, we can consider currents
in $D$ Euclidean spacetime dimensions.  In that case,
the classical action is equal to the
energy of the magnetic field produced by those currents
(magnetostatics in $D$ dimensions).  Using the textbook
formula~\cite{jackson_classical_1975}
for the magnetostatic energy associated with a current density
$\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x})$,
%
\be
S = \frac{1}{2} \int d^3\mathbf{x}\, d^3\mathbf{x}^\prime\,
\frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}) \cdot
  \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}^\prime)}{
  \left| \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^\prime\right|} \, ,
\eq
%
we can find the action associated with a number of thin wires
carrying a constant current. (We set the current equal to 1 in
the following.)

In the case of two Polyakov loops with opposite currents separated
by distance $r$ with periodic boundary conditions, period $L$,
there is a self-energy term plus an interaction term:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
S_\Phi &=& 2 \int_0^L dx \int_{x+\varepsilon/2}^\infty dy
\left(\frac{1}{y-x} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{(y-x)^2 + r^2}}\right) \\
  &=& 2 L \log\left(\frac{r}{\varepsilon}\right) + O(\varepsilon)\, .
\end{eqnarray}
%
Thus, we obtain the usual $L \log(r)$ term plus a
self-energy term proportional to the length
of the currents, $2L$.  The $\log(\varepsilon)$ divergence
is from approximating the current density as a thin wire.
Since the normalization
of this field relative to the bare link fields is
unknown, one can fit the Coulomb contribution to the
Polyakov loop correlator using
\be
       c_q 2 L \log(r) + c_p 2 L \, , \label{cpf}
\eq
where $c_q$ and $c_p$ are unknown.

In the case of a $w_1\times w_2$ Wilson loop, we obtain
a more complicated expression
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  S_W &=& 2 \int_0^{w_1} dx \int_{x+\varepsilon}^{w_1} \frac{dx^\prime}{x^\prime-x}
               \nonumber\\
               & &  - \int_0^{w_1} dx \int_{0}^{w_1} \frac{dx^\prime}{
                 \sqrt{(x^\prime-x)^2+ w_2^2}}
               \nonumber\\
               & &  +\left[w_1 \leftrightarrow w_2 \right]\\
               &=&  \Theta\!\left(w_1, w_2\right) +
               \Theta\!\left(w_2, w_1\right)
              - 2 (w_1 + w_2) \log(\varepsilon) + O(\varepsilon) 
\end{eqnarray}
where
\be
\Theta\!\left(\ell, r\right) = 2 \left(
    \sqrt{\ell^2+r^2} - \ell - r
    - \ell\log\left(\frac{\sqrt{\ell^2+r^2} + \ell}{r\ell}\right)
   \right) \;.
\eq
Similar the the above, 
we obtain a self-energy term that is proportional to the perimeter of
the rectangle.  Thus, we can fit the Coulomb
contribution to the Wilson loop using
%
\be
    c_q  \left(\Theta\!\left(w_1, w_2\right) +
               \Theta\!\left(w_2, w_1\right)\right)
        + c_p  2\left(w_1+w_2\right)  \label{cwf}
\eq
%
where $c_p$ and $c_q$ in Eqns.~(\ref{cpf}) and (\ref{cwf})
should be equivalent.

     for the lowest $0^{++}$ glueball.
     We do not see the desired exponential behavior.
  \label{corrLink995}}
\end{figure}

We can look at other properties of the gauge configuration
as we move along the trajectory.  In particular, let us look
at the correlators of the charge conjugation even plaquette operator
\be
  \left\langle
  \left(\Re \plaquette_{\mu,\nu}(x) - \plaquette_\mathrm{avg}\right)
  \left(\Re \plaquette_{\alpha,\beta}(y) - \plaquette_\mathrm{avg}\right)
  \right\rangle
\eq
as a function of the separation of the two plaquettes
\be
\mathrm{separation} =
        \left\lVert \left(x+a \hat{\mu}/2+ a\hat{\nu}/2\right) -
             \left(y+a \hat{\alpha}/2+ a\hat{\beta}/2\right)
             \right\rVert \; .
\eq
This correlator couples to the $0^{++}$ glueball states.

In Fig.~\ref{corr2dEven}, we plot the correlation for various relative
orientations of the two plaquettes for several points along the
best trajectory in~\ref{trajectory3}.  We also plot an exponential
corresponding to Teper's value for the $0^{++}$ glueball,
mass $0.5517(38)/a$ for $\beta=28$, $L^3=23^3$~\cite{teper_$mathrmsun$_1998}.
The exponential only demonstrates that there is qualitative agreement.
Since the correlator also has contributions from the excited $0^{++}$
states, a quantitative fit would require a more extensive analysis,
with additional operators in the correlation function.  However, one
would expect the single plaquette operator to couple very strongly
to the lowest state and not so strongly to the excited states.

Likewise, we can look at the charge conjugation odd correlator
\be
  \left\langle
  \left(\Im \plaquette_{\mu,\nu}(x) - \plaquette_\mathrm{avg}\right)
  \left(\Im \plaquette_{\alpha,\beta}(y) - \plaquette_\mathrm{avg}\right)
  \right\rangle   \; ,
\eq
corresponding to the $0^{--}$ glueball states; see Fig.~\ref{corr2dOdd}.
Also shown is an exponential corresponding to the lowest $0^{--}$ state,
mass $0.8133(57)/a$ \cite{teper_$mathrmsun$_1998}.

In the case where the off-diagonal color blocks of $H$ are dropped,
we do not see the desired exponential behavior in the correlator,
Fig.~\ref{corrLink995}.
